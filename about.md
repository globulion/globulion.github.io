We are developing theoretical methods to describe
chemistry at large scales with quantum mechanical
accuracy. The focus is in particular on solvation phenomena
and spectroscopy of condensed phase systems.
Our long standing goal is formulation of fragmentation
method that goes beyond standard classical *ab initio* force fields
and is applicable to a wide range of problems in material and medicinal chemistry.

Following our fragmentation philosophy, 
we developed two methods that are applicable for:
 - calculation of vibrational spectra of local IR probes in condensed phase
 - calculation of Frenkel Hamiltonians of extended systems, including excitonic energy transfer couplings

We are merging the approaches and further improving our fragmentation
scheme for application to extended systems
such as optoelectronics, interfaces and complex biomolecular systems.

method that is an important part
of our fragmentation strategy:
