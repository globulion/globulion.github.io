# Template notes

<!-- You can delete this directory on your copy of this template project. -->

This project was generated using the Jekyll CLI for a starting point. 

Now it also includes a demo of Jekyll _Collections_ too. See the _Languages_ section on the site, the `languages.md` file and the `_languages` directory. 


## Environment choices 

Most sites will probably be okay with Jekyll 3 and the GitHub Pages default environment, as used in this demo.

But, for more customization such as Jekyll 4 and GitHub Actions, see this template:
