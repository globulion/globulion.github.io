I am doing research in the field of large-scale Quantum Chemistry -- investigating
complex condensed-phase systems from the perspective of Quantum Mechanics. 
I am currently a research associate in Goethe University Frankfurt, in the 
[Theoretical Chemistry of Complex Systems group](https://www.theochem.uni-frankfurt.de/teaching.php).
